# Active Patterns
**Richard Dalton**

### Summary

Pattern matching is a standard feature of most functional programming languages. F# takes it to the next level with Active Patterns.

In this live coding session I'll demonstrate what pattern matching is and how it can greatly simplify your code. With that as a foundation we'll look at the different kinds of Active Patterns that F# supports and how they are used.

If you are learning or using F#, Active Patterns are a feature of the language that you can derive significant benefit from immediately.
